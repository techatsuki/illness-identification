    <h4> hypertension: </h4>
    <p> 
      Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the arteries. It is a significant risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Glucose Level</h4>
    <p>Glucose level refers to the concentration of glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. It's typically measured in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) in the United States, or in millimoles of glucose per liter of blood (mmol/L) in other parts of the world.</p>
     <h4>BMI</h4> 
     <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's a useful tool for assessing whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height, but it doesn't provide information about specific biomarkers like cholesterol levels.</p>
    <h4>cholesterol</h4>
    <p>If you're interested in knowing your cholesterol levels, you would need to get a blood test done. This involves drawing a small sample of blood, usually from a vein in your arm, and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. The results will be reported in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L), which are the standard units for cholesterol measurement.</p>
    <h4>Fasting Blood Sugar</h4>
    <p>Fasting blood sugar refers to the level of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream after an extended period of not consuming food or beverages that contain calories. This period of fasting typically lasts for at least 8 hours.

        <br> The fasting blood sugar level is an important indicator of a person's glucose metabolism and is commonly used to screen for diabetes or prediabetes. Here are the general categories for fasting blood sugar levels:
        
       <br> - Normal Fasting Blood Sugar:
         <br> - Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) <br>
        
        - Prediabetes (Impaired Fasting Glucose): <br>
          - Fasting Blood Sugar between 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) <br>
        
        - Diabetes: <br>
          - Fasting Blood Sugar of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher <br>
        
        Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and individual target levels may vary based on factors like age, existing health conditions, and individual health goals. If you have concerns about your fasting blood sugar levels, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and guidance. They can provide personalized recommendations and, if necessary, help you develop a plan for managing your blood sugar effectively.</p> <br>
